description: I went out into the wild, threw my ideas at the Internet, took my share of crickets, and eventually, *eventually*, found my way. Let me take you on the rollercoaster that was the journey to my note-taking app—Fleeting Notes.

So today, I'm breaking out the good, the bad, and the not-so-ugly from my first launch experience with Fleeting Notes. In a nutshell: "The first launch shouldn't be the last launch."

## The Quest for Purpose (or, Why SynchroCise Wasn’t It) 🕵️‍♂️

Before Fleeting Notes became my dream project, there was [[Embracing New Paths - From Side Project to Resignation (Part 1)|SynchroCise.]] Yeah, I was all in, but something was off. The lesson learned? Gotta start with a problem I really care about—not just a fancy solution looking for a problem.

## When Life Gives You Problems... Turn Them into Ideas 🍋

So I was brainstorming—like legit scribbling stuff in my notepad—when I noticed a pattern. I suck at retrieving notes when I need them. It's like tossing a message in a bottle into the ocean and expecting it to come back when you're thirsty. Nah, doesn't work that way.

## My Own Worst Enemy: Notes and ADHD 🧠

Ever feel like your mind's a pinball machine and ideas are just bouncing around? That's me in a nutshell. Now, I haven't had it clinically verified, but I’m pretty sure I've got ADHD or something close. Ideas pop up; if I don’t capture them, they vanish like mist. Poof!

## The Birth of a Vision: Making Notes Less Fleeting 🎨

So I decided I needed something better. Something to capture these fleeting thoughts and bring them back like a boomerang when I need them. That’s how the concept of "Fleeting Notes" came to life.

## The Power of Backlinks, or How I Found My Note-Taking Zen 🕸

If you haven't dabbled in networked notes yet, you're missing out. It's like making your thoughts talk to each other, in a very non-creepy way. I believe it's the future, y'all.

## The Niche Hunt: Zettelkasten and Obsidian Lovers Unite! 🎯

After binge-watching every Y Combinator video out there, I realized that niche markets are where it's at. My target? The cool cats using the Zettelkasten method and folks loving on Obsidian.

## The MVP Grind and Pre-Launch Hustle 🛠

Building the MVP was a marathon of coding, cursing, coffee, and user surveys. I was pumped! I was going to quit my day job, buy a Lambo, and be on the cover of Entrepreneur. Easy, right?

## The Launch: When Reality Sinks Its Teeth In 🚀

I launched. And then... crickets. Man, I was stumped. All that preparation and not even a "meh" from the interwebs. It was a reality gut-punch I didn't see coming.

## Stumbling But Not Falling: Picking Myself Up 🔄

I was down but heck no, not out. I knew I was onto something; I just had to dig deeper. It's back to the drawing board, but you know what? That's another story for another day.

## The Real Takeaway 🎯

So, what’s the takeaway from all this? Keep launching. Seriously, your first takeoff is rarely going to be a SpaceX success. Use it to fuel the next one. And the next. And yes, the one after that.

Until next time, my friends. Keep innovating, keep failing, but most importantly, keep going. 🚀

Peace out! ✌️
