Good copy: [[Embracing New Paths - From Side Project to Resignation (Part 1)]]
- TLDR: I never had big goals to be an entrepreneur, I just wanted to build cool things. Moral of the story here is to release stuff into market ASAP and build something you care about! 

- get a lot of questions asking me about how and why i quit my full-time job. i want to write this to maybe inspire other people to do the same or for people to just read a good story.
- Anyways, my entrepreneur journey started after graduation. I was working full-time at Geotab and I only started a couple of months back right after graduation.
- At the time, I was content with my position.
- One day, my friend invited me to join a hackathon he was in the process of padding his resume so I decided to join to help him out.
- We created an app called SynchroCise and ended up winning the hackathon. 
- SynchroCise was an app that allowed you to virtually sync your workouts with your friends.
- Since we won the hackathon, I thought that was plenty of validation. Because if the judges at a hackathon thought it was cool, Why wouldn't other people pay for it?
- So I continued building SynchroCise, while working at my full-time job. 
- I really wanted to try bringing it into market but I was never brave enough because I thought the product was never good enough. So i just continued piling on feature after feature.
- After a couple of months of working on it on the side, I decided to take a course in Waterloo for entrepreneurship. This is BET300 (highly recommend btw).
- While doing this course, they had me do this thing called "market research".
- Through market research I realized that a similar product already existed and it had everything I planned to build! It was a huge smack in the face moment for me.
- Turns out there wasn't a big need for this solution, so I decided to pivot my idea, so I could target personal trainers that want to sync workouts with their clients.
- Through more market research I realized that products like this already exist and have a full fleet of features that I haven't even thought of yet!
- So I pivoted and pivoted until I was tired of pivoting. I had a solution in search of a problem and I realized that this is the completely wrong approach.
- I knew that if I kept pushing, there was a chance that I could strike gold, but I wasn't willing to put in that much effort because I didn't really care about virtual exercise. I just enjoyed building and I didn't realize it was so difficult to put things to market
- What I learned from this experience, was to work on something you are deeply passionate about because the journey is going to be long and arduous and always start with the problem not the solution
- So through this, I thought long and hard about what problems I faced in my life and how I could solve that. And this is how Fleeting Notes came to be. But that's a story for another time.
