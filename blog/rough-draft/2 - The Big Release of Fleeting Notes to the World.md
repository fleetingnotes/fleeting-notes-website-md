-  TLDR; The first launch shouldn't be the last launch. keep launching over and over again until you hit something good. This is the story of how I first launched Fleeting Notes. Also, find one value prop and work on it, don't add anything extra!

- From my experience working on SynchroCise, my previous idea, I realized that I needed to work on I was truly passionate about. So in order to find problems I'm really passionate about I looked inwards towards the problems I face on a day-to-day basis
- What I saw was that I would always have interesting things to jot down but no way to access them as they would pile on and on
- I wanted a world where, I could quickly jot down a thought and have it be useful in the future. I have self-diagnosed ADHD so I'd always need to write things down super quickly or else it'll be lost forever
- I was reading a lot about Zettelkasten at the time and i figured that this would be the best niche to start off with. Because people using the Zettelkasten have a concept called Fleeting Notes is a way for them to jot down their thoughts. 
- Since they already have a structured way to capture their thoughts, if I can improve their process of capturing Fleeting Notes, I figured that it would be game changing
- So that's what I did, I created an app that helped people capture their Fleeting Notes faster into Obsidian. I spent a couple of months building it because I wanted this app to be perfect.
- I also decided to add fancy features that I thought were "essential", a few of them being linking and backlinking, full-text search, a way to capture the source of the note and a whole new "innovative" UI for taking notes.
- After months of building, I finally had my first MVP working. I wrote a blog post, and posted it in the Zettelkasten reddit.:

	- https://www.reddit.com/r/Zettelkasten/comments/tionl5/why_do_we_need_literature_notes/
- It got less than 10 upvotes, plus a lot of comments questioning why the app is necessary. I was devastated. An app that I thought was "game changing", was in fact something that people didn't really need.
- But I still had my vision that I wanted to work towards my vision. So I kept posting and posting from different angles into the subreddit but nothing really stuck. In fact I even got a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Zettelkasten/comments/tionl5/comment/i1f6u0l/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that almost crushed all my will.
> If I'm attending a lecture or reading an article, I don't want to take the time to make a bunch of properly linked individual notes. I prefer to have a single note for the lecture and write things down quickly. Then later I can extract the key points into individual notes, and link them to other notes as needed.
- Now that was my experience during my first launch and the Zettelkasten reddit. Through this experience, I realized that maybe this niche of people weren't the right people. But, I didn't want to give up there, I still had a vision and I still wanted to enact it.
- The lesson here is to not be afraid of rejection and keep launching while sticking to the vision.
- See my plan in enacting my vision and getting my first customer in my next blog post!

- Now that I was out of the Synchrocise phase, my next focus was a note-

- Tried to target the zettelkasten niche.
- So in this time, I was thinking of problems I faced in my life. One problem that resonated with me was the lack of the ability to take down a quick thought and have it be useful in the future.
- Right now, when taking quick notes from Apple Notes or Google Keep, I would take down the note but as I took more notes, the old note would be buried in a pile of new notes and I wouldn't be able to resurface the note I needed when I needed it.
- I think I have ADHD (self-diagnosed) and I always want to write down things that come to mind because I know if I don't write things down they'll be gone forever. 
- So I wanted a system that would allow me to quickly jot notes down and have a system to resurface notes that come up in the future. This was my vision. 
- My solution for this vision was to utilize the power of backlinks in quick note-taking. I've recently got into taking networked notes and I believed (and still believe) that building connections between your notes is the future of note-taking. By using networked notes, notes resurface themselves automatically  
- Also, Fleeting Notes perfectly encompassed my vision so I decided to name my application that. 
- Through my experience watching all the YC videos, I learned a thing or two about startups. One thing I knew was I needed to start with a niche. My niche was specific users who used the Zettelkasten method and were users of Obsidian. 
- My MVP consisted of a product that allowed you to take notes quickly from within my app and build links between their notes (like wikipedia)
- So I spent a month or two putting together my first version, I did a bunch of user surveys, wrote a bunch of blog posts in preparation for the release and saved a lot of articles where people experience this problem.
- I was ready to launch my product and have it be a huge success! I was going to be super successful and I'd be able to quit my job to pursue this full-time!
- But when I released it. Nothing happened. I got little to no response and people didn't really have a big need for it.
- I was a little bit shocked considering how much prep work I did. I thought I followed all the steps, but it turns out I was lying to myself. 
- I was down, but I wasn't defeated. I knew this was a problem for myself so using that as my north star I pushed forward and tried to better understand exactly the problem I faced.
- But now it was back to the drawing board and going at which angle to take this startup. So I went back to the drawing board, but that's a story for the next time.
- The moral of the story is that your first launch shouldn't be your last launch. Just keep launching because you're most likely not going to get it right in the first try.
