- TLDR; I do a marketing strategy where I write an article typically a how-to guide and see how well it sticks. I somehow include my app and use this to iterate on my strategy. Also, when creating content, it's all about generating value. I got flamed on Reddit and people weren't happy with the content I was creating. It's brutal out there.

- So after my first release, I knew some things had to change. I figured rather than doing user surveys, I would try to sell my product through marketing. I'd talk about a problem tangentially related to my product and talk about how my product solves this problem. 
- So at the same time, I was hoping this would bring more users to my application, improve my site SEO, and validate the problem (by seeing how many people resonated with the blog post). 
- The plan was to write the blog post and publish it both on Reddit and my website.
- Originally I tried only publishing it on my website and adding a link from Reddit to my website, but the post didn't get that much engagement and I wasn't able to validate as well. So instead I just published the entire article on Reddit and then linked to my website. 
- When I first started, I got flamed for putting ads. I got downvoted to hell and I felt disheartened and exhausted, but I kept pushing forward.
- What I realized was that the post needs to provide value to the user and I started more on providing value and less on selling my product.
- I found that this helped a lot and allowed me to get more engagement and validate better. 
- Slowly but surely more users were trickling in and I was getting more and more users. It was working but I wasn't getting the level of traction I needed to be able to quit my job.
- There was nothing major, but through user conversations and deep reflection, I learned that a huge value proposition for me was the automatic sync to Obsidian
- At this time, my product was more focused on the linking side within the app + quick note-taking and I wanted to keep it that way, but what I realized was that all of that was trivial and my main problem was getting the quick notes into Obsidian.
- Until I made my post "Google Keep but for Obsidian". In this post, I got a huge amount of traction and a ton of user sign ups. Even to this day, I get a lot of traffic coming from this post (thanks to SEO). I even got a few paying users which was super duper exciting!
