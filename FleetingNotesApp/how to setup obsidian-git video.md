Maybe you want to regularly back up your vault or perhaps you'd like to publish your blog post straight from Obsidian (if you're interested see my other video on how to do that). Anyways, here's the easiest way to setup the obsidian-git. 

Here's the easiest way to 


1. Fork the repository OR create a new one
2. Download Git
3. Install Obsidian Git Plugin
4. Clone repository to subfolder (Highly recommend subfolder)
5. Get Personal Access Token
6. Try backup!
