I get a lot of questions asking how I process Fleeting Notes once they land in Obsidian. There are many ways to approach this but here's the best method I found for myself.

1. Install the Obsidian Dataview plugin
2. Enable the Daily Notes plugin in the Obsidian settings
3. Create a template file for the daily notes, and add the path of the file to the `Template file location`
4. Here's the template I use 
````
## Notes
- 
## Fleeting Notes
```dataview

```

## Tasks from Fleeting Notes
````


This method takes advantage of the daily notes and the dataview plugin. If you don't happen to use daily notes, I'm sure it won't be too much trouble to adapt the dataview plugin query to your workflow.
