# What's new and what's to come
I spent a lot more time than expected on getting this plugin functional command thing working. Thankfully it's almost through the door. Checkout the [plugin repo](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-plugins) for more info!

## Released / In the next Release
- [Plugin Functional Commands](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/414). This will unblock features like:
	- [Integration with Open AI and custom prompts:](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/604) Setup custom prompts and use ChatGPT right within Fleeting Notes.
	- [OCR / Image-to-text](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/531): Take an image, share it to Fleeting Notes, then have the text within the image transcribed into text accessible within Obsidian. 
	- Send to... (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Github, [Notion](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-plugins/issues/3), etc.): Send directly to any service from a simple command all within Fleeting Notes.
- [Sharing images + files into Fleeting Notes](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/183): Share images and files into Fleeting Notes on mobile devices.
- Plus a few bug fixes and small quality of life improvements!

## Upcoming
- [Removing the save button](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/592): The save button has been around for a while and with features like auto-save it has become redundant and confusing.
- [Share notes with other sources](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/585): Share text to other apps like how you'd do in other apps
- [Global Shortcut Keys](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/613): Allows for users to open Fleeting Notes directly from the desktop through shortcut keys

# Personal Update: Looking to Grow
I've been pouring my heart and soul into something very close to my chest - my digital brainchild, Fleeting Notes. This venture isn't just another startup for me, it's a pursuit for financial independence, an ambition to create a meaningful impact, and a chance to alleviate a deep-seated personal pain point. I genuinely desire Fleeting Notes to flourish, and I'm wholeheartedly committed to seeing it grow.

Hoping to turbocharge my dreams, I applied to YCombinator - a move I hoped would be my catapult into the stratosphere of startup success. Yet, here I am, still waiting for their response. The more I journey into the fascinating yet unpredictable world of startups, the more I realize there is no magic recipe, no silver bullet that guarantees instant growth or success.

This realization throws me into a whirlpool of questions. Am I marketing enough or effectively? Should I integrate AI into my product for a competitive edge? Could a better understanding of user analytics inform my decisions and drive growth? Perhaps I should arrange more customer meetings for insights, or improve my workflow systems to boost productivity? And, maybe the most perplexing of all - am I even targeting the right niche?

The biggest question though: What should be my focal point to truly maximize growth? It's a question that often keeps me awake at night.

With the AI mania sweeping across the tech world, it sometimes feels like I'm missing the bus. Seeing others grow exponentially often sends chills down my spine - am I not doing something right? The thought of investing my blood, sweat, and tears into something that might not resonate with people is a terrifying prospect.

This past week, I've admittedly not done much in terms of marketing. Instead, I've been experimenting with creating TikToks, hoping to tap into this vibrant, fast-paced platform for potential growth. Also, I've put the finishing touches on a new feature that I hope will act as a catalyst to drive further growth.

As I pen down this post, I stand at 149 active subscribers. This represents a modest increase of 2 from the previous week, and falls 37 short of my immediate goal of 186. Despite the shortfall, I'm not disheartened. I've taken the time to reflect and learn from this week's journey, and I'm optimistic that my next newsletter will carry better news.

Let's continue this journey together - onwards and upwards!
