A new way to add notes into Obsidian:

- Removing all in-app analytics and error reporting and switching it to a feedback system. Also, how I am converting it to 
- **talk about features here**
- **A slower month and re-evaluating different marketing channels**. Applied to startup accelerator YCombinator Youtube partnerships, Tiktoks, Youtube shorts, etc


An Update for my startup:
- These two weeks were a slower week, and rightfully so because I put more emphasis in developing app features rather than marketing and bettering myself through AI.
- I bought into the AI hype. I'm looking at ways to utilize AI to make my workflows more efficient. From content creation, marketing, to coding. I'm going to try and utilize AI to help me work faster and more efficient. Once I better myself, I can better Fleeting Notes at break neck speeds. I've attached a photo
- On top of this I've applied to the startup accelerator YCombinator. I'm hoping to get an interview in the coming month. If I do get in, you may expect even bigger changes within Fleeting Notes. Here's the one minute pitch I made to apply if you're curious.
