# Fleeting Notes - Now in Your Browser Sidebar!
Have you ever noticed something new in your Chrome browser? Just like those secret menu items at your favorite cafe, our tech world often surprises us with hidden treasures. And this time, it's a shiny, new sidebar button in Chrome.

Yes, you read that right. A sidebar button has recently made its way into your everyday browsing life. But that's not where the fun ends. Chrome decided to go an extra mile and introduced an API, making it possible to add chrome extensions right inside that sidebar. How cool is that?

Well, you guessed it! I simply couldn't resist the temptation. So, I rolled up my sleeves and got to work. After a couple of late nights, a few cups of coffee, and a ton of code lines later, I'm beyond excited to introduce you to something I've been working on.

I've added **Fleeting Notes** to the Sidebar for Chrome & Firefox! Yes, your beloved note-taking app is now just a click away, comfortably nestled within the browser sidebar. And the best part? This sidebar smoothly persists across webpages without hovering annoyingly above the contentâ€”it graciously readjusts the web content to make room for itself. So, you've got your own neat corner to take quick notes while you surf the internet!

But wait, there's more! Here's something that absolutely blew my mind. You can even have the sidebar open while watching a YouTube video in full-screen. Isn't that absolutely crazy? It's like having popcorn while enjoying your favorite movie, without missing out on any details.

Now you might wonder, how do you get this awesome tool in your sidebar? It's simple. Just click on the sidebar button and select 'Fleeting Notes' in the dropdown. Voila! Your note-taking partner is ready to assist you.

For my Firefox folks out there, I've got you covered as well. You just need to add the sidebar button to your controls. Not sure how to do that? No worries! You can find easy instructions [right here](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/use-firefox-sidebar-access-bookmarks-history-synced).

With Fleeting Notes in your browser sidebar, capturing bite-sized information has never been easier. So, what are you waiting for? Give it a try, and let's make note-taking a breeze!


# Personal Update: Becoming a Manager
I've always loved the thrill of diving headfirst into every nook and cranny of my business. I mean, who doesn't like getting their hands a little dirty, right? But I've had a realization recently - there's a limit to how much one person can do. If I spend all my energy working _in_ my business, I can't spare any to work _on_ growing my business. You see the conundrum here?

So, I've decided to turn the page. I've just brought aboard my very first team member, to take some of the weight off my shoulders. For now, they're part-timing, but who knows? This move could be the key that frees up my time to focus on expanding Fleeting Notes.

Also, I have some personal news. Ever since I left my full-time job to follow my entrepreneurial dreams, things got a bit...lonely. I'd find myself wishing I had someone to talk to about the ups and downs of the startup life. But recently, I've found my tribe - a group of friends who are also navigating the wild world of startups. It's amazing, really. Trading stories, comparing notes, and learning from each other's experiences...it's something special.

Alright, let's talk about Fleeting Notes now. How's it been going, you ask? Well, progress has been steady. I'd love to tell you that we're skyrocketing towards stardom, but let's keep it real - growing a business is tough, especially in the consumer segment. We've chosen the hard mode, and it's living up to its name.

As of now, we have 150 active subscribers (yay!). That's one more than two weeks ago, which might not sound like much, but hey, growth is growth. Still, I can't help but eye that goal of 207 subscribers that I'd set, which leaves us 57 short. Why 207, you ask? Well, that's the stepping stone I've identified towards the ultimate goal of hitting 1,000 subscribers by month's end.

But worry not, we're not just sitting here twiddling our thumbs. We're actively experimenting with a plethora of strategies. New landing pages, optimizing our app store presence, and much more are on the table. Who knows? Maybe one of these experiments will be the secret ingredient we need to kick things up a notch. Fingers crossed!
