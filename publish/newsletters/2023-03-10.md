## A fresh new look
I am thrilled to announce the latest update to Fleeting Notes! Over the past few weeks, I've been working closely with a UI/UX designer to provide a better note-taking experience that's fully geared towards taking fleeting notes.

The purpose of Fleeting Notes is to take quick notes, so I wanted to make the note-taking experience as frictionless as possible. You'll notice a more intuitive and streamlined interface that allows you to jot down your thoughts quickly and effortlessly. The new UI is designed with you in mind, with features that make it easy to take notes on the go and access them later.

I am proud to say that the new UI feels like a total rebrand. Before, the app was a scrappy tool, but with the new UI, I now think it's more "legit." It gives me more confidence to recommend the application and even ask people to review it. With the new UI, I believe Fleeting Notes is now more approachable and user-friendly than ever before. So, go ahead and check out the [new UI](https://my.fleetingnotes.app/) today! I am confident that you'll love the new look and feel of Fleeting Notes.

Keep in mind, this all started with a poll on Discord, where you guys overwhelmingly pushed for a better UI. As a solo developer, your feedback is incredibly valuable to me. So feel free to provide your suggestions and feedback. A simple reply can go a long way! I will continue to work hard to make Fleeting Notes the best app for taking quick notes.

Thank you for your continued support, and happy note-taking!

## What's coming next
- [Voice Assistant -> Note.](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/529) Ideas pop into our heads at odd times, and sometimes we need to a way to take notes hands-free (e.g. driving).  
- [Desktop support.](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-flutter/issues/186) To access Fleeting Notes directly from a native app.
- [Source metadata available within the Obsidian plugin](https://github.com/fleetingnotes/fleeting-notes-obsidian/issues/63). Gives access to the source title, description, and image preview as variables within the note template.
- And other feature requests made by you ðŸ«µ  (e.g. by replying to this email)

## Leaving my full-time job to pursue my passion project
I've been thinking about leaving my job for a few months now. I've complained about it for many months, but I've never actually done anything about it. I think it's because the job was comfortable, and I had a steady paycheck. But all along, I've been passionate about developing Fleeting Notes and building something of my own.

I've seen some progress with Fleeting Notes, but I've been hesitant to quit my stable and well-paying job. However, my friends and family have been so supportive, and that's made a huge difference. They're the reason I finally decided to take the leap and see what happens. It's scary to leave the comfort of a stable job, but I'm excited about the possibilities.

The decision to leave my job wasn't easy, but I know it's the right one for me. I'm looking forward to seeing how I can grow Fleeting Notes without a full-time job. It's an exciting time, and I'm grateful for the support of my loved ones. My goal is to have 1000 active subscribers by the end of the year, and I'm excited to work towards that.

Regarding my metric update for Fleeting Notes, I've decided that sharing the number of active subscribers is more valuable than monthly recurring revenue. Right now, I have 110 active subscribers, which is up from 103 in February. I believe the new UI and improved stability of the app are the reasons for the growth. I've worked hard to make the user experience better, and it's paying off.
