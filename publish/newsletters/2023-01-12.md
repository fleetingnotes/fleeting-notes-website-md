## A sneak peak on the fresh UI

I asked a poll in my Discord server and realized the thing most people wanted was for a better UI. So I got off my high horse and decided to create a new UI for the application. But there's a problem, I'm not a UI designer.

Instead I decided to replicate an [example mail app](https://discord.com/channels/910294799188385885/948594798892294206/1061470237586894889) straight from the material design website. There were still some missing pieces that I couldn't transfer form the mail app to my UI (e.g. settings screen and certain UI interactions). For those scenarios, I decided to copy the UI from other apps like Google Keep and Raindrop. It was quite the experience but I'm almost near the finish line and I'm excited to hear your thoughts on this new UI. Here's a sample of what I have so far. By no means is this the final solution, but if you have any feedback on the design, I'd be more than happy to hear it. Just hit the reply button and let me know your thoughts!

## Stagnating at $300 / month
So my explosive growth since my inception has flat lined and even dipped down a bit. Currently I'm sitting at around $288 [[monthly-recurring-revenue|MRR]]. You might be wondering, what happened in October, and why did the growth stop there?
![[mrr-newsletter-1.png]]

In October I did a [[migrating-from-firebase-to-supabase|migration]] that introduced a few bugs into the app. The bugs made me lose a few users and reduced my [[conversion-rate]]. The following two months after October, I was working on fixing the bugs and improving the stability of Fleeting Notes by adding a more comprehensive test suite. But since the end of December, I've been more getting more confident in the stability of my application. Even in my chart it can be seen that the [[monthly-recurring-revenue|MRR]] has been reflective of that. 

Now I'm at a point where I'm confident in the stability of the application and I'm more focused in bettering the user experience as well as adding key new features. I'm hoping to do a 1.0 release of my application in the coming few months and here are some of the things I hope to complete before this major release:

- Improve UI
- Add customizable plugins. 
- Add the Safari browser extension
